            "response": "Expert 1: Step 1: Define COVID-19 - COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Step 2: Gather information - I will gather information from reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Step 3: Identify common symptoms - According to the CDC, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and congestion or runny nose. Step 4: Analyze symptoms - I will analyze the symptoms listed by the CDC to determine which symptoms are most commonly reported and which ones are less common. Step 5: Compare to other illnesses - I will compare the symptoms of COVID-19 to other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu, to see if there are any similarities or differences. Step 6: Consider at-risk populations - I will consider if certain populations, such as older adults or those with underlying health conditions, may experience different or more severe symptoms of COVID-19. Step 7: Check for consistency - I will check for consistency in the information gathered from different sources and ensure that the symptoms I have identified align with current healthcare science. Step 8: Conclusion - Based on my analysis, the common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with other symptoms including fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and congestion or runny nose. These symptoms may vary in severity and can also overlap with symptoms of other respiratory illnesses. Expert 2: Step 1: Define COVID-19 - As mentioned by Expert 1, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Step 2: Gather information - I will also gather information from reliable sources such as the CDC and WHO. Step 3: Identify common symptoms - In addition to the symptoms listed by the CDC, I will also consider other symptoms that have been reported by healthcare professionals and individuals with COVID-19. These may include chills, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and new confusion or inability to wake up. Step 4: Analyze symptoms - I will analyze the symptoms identified and determine their frequency and severity in individuals with COVID-19. Step 5: Compare to other illnesses - I will compare the symptoms of COVID-19 not only to other respiratory illnesses but also to other conditions that may have similar symptoms, such as allergies or asthma. Step 6: Consider at-risk populations - I will also consider if certain populations, such as healthcare workers or individuals living in densely populated areas, may experience different or more severe symptoms of COVID-19. Step 7: Check for consistency - I will check for consistency in the information gathered and ensure that the symptoms identified align with current healthcare science. Step 8: Conclusion - Based on my analysis, the common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with other symptoms including fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, chills, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and new confusion or inability to wake up. These symptoms may vary in severity and can also overlap with symptoms of other respiratory illnesses or conditions. Expert 3: Step 1: Define COVID-19 - As mentioned by the previous experts, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Step 2: Gather information - In addition to the sources mentioned, I will also gather information from recent studies and research articles on COVID-19. Step 3: Identify common symptoms - I will consider all reported symptoms of COVID-19 and categorize them into respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological symptoms. Step 4: Analyze symptoms - I will analyze the frequency and severity of each symptom category and determine which symptoms are most commonly reported. Step 5: Compare to other illnesses - I will compare the symptoms of COVID-19 to other respiratory illnesses, as well as other viral infections, to identify any unique or distinguishing symptoms. Step 6: Consider at-risk populations - I will consider if certain populations, such as children or pregnant women, may experience different or more severe symptoms of COVID-19. Step 7: Check for consistency - I will check for consistency in the information gathered and ensure that the symptoms identified align with current healthcare science. Step 8: Conclusion - Based on my analysis, the common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with other symptoms including fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, chills, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and new confusion or inability to wake up. These symptoms can vary in severity and may also differ depending on the individual's age, underlying health conditions, and other factors. However, the most commonly reported symptoms align with current healthcare science and should be considered when diagnosing and managing cases of COVID-19.",

Step 2: Research current literature and guidelines from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Step 3: From the research, identify the common symptoms of COVID-19 reported by healthcare professionals and patients. Step 4: List the symptoms, which include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, loss of taste or smell, and sore throat. Step 5: Analyze the list of symptoms and group them into categories based on the affected body systems (respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, etc.). Step 6: Review the list of symptoms and categorization with other experts to ensure accuracy and completeness. Step 7: Check for any conflicting or contradictory information in the literature and make necessary revisions. Step 8: Use critical thinking to evaluate if the identified symptoms align with the known pathophysiology of COVID-19. Step 9: Discuss and debate the findings with other experts to reach a consensus on the common symptoms of COVID-19. Step 10: Finalize the list of common symptoms and make it available for use in healthcare practice and public education.  Expert 2: Step 1: Start by defining COVID-19 as a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

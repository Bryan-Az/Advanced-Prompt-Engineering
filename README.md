# Advanced-Prompt-Engineering

This project aims to comprehensively explore prompt engineering techniques for OpenAI's language models.

- **Section A (Prompting Paradigms)**: Demonstrated through Colab notebooks located in notebooks/prompt_techniques/ showcasing various prompting paradigms (ICL, CoT, etc.) with both successful applications and failure cases.
- **Section B (Prompt Templates)**: Explores and showcases 21 diverse prompt templates within the notebooks/prompt_templates.ipynb notebook.
- **Section C (Prompts by Use-case)**: User and System Prompts generated for ten diverse fields (HR, teaching, finance) are located in prompts/field_specific_prompts.json, accompanied by test cases in utils/.
- **Section D (Palm 2 API Implementation)**: Implements OpenAI's Palm 2 API in Colab, showcasing its capabilities through examples within notebooks/api_examples.ipynb.
- **Section E (API Function Calls & Use Cases)**: Demonstrates API function calls using the generated prompts as practical use cases for interacting with the OpenAI API, also found in notebooks/api_examples.ipynb.
- **Section F (System Prompt Examples)**: Provides practical examples of system prompts within notebooks/api_examples.ipynb.
